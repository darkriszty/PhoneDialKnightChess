# PhoneDialKnightChess

Sample toy app for an algorithmic problem.

```
Imagine you place a knight chess piece on a phone dial pad. This chess piece moves in an uppercase "L" shape. 
Every time the knight lands on a key, we dial that key and make another hop. The starting position counts as being dialed.
How many distinct numbers can you dial in N hops from a particular starting position?
